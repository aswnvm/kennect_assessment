JSON Web Tokens(JWT):

JSON Web Tokens are used to transport information about a client's identity and characteristics. 
The server signs this information in order to determine whether it has been tampered with after being sent to the client. 
This prevents an attacker from altering the identity or any other attributes.
For example, Changing the role from the simple user to admin or changing the client login.

This token is generated during authentication (and delivered if authentication is successful) and is validated by the server before any processing begins. 
It is used by an application to allow a client to provide a token representing the user's "identity card" to the server and allow the server to securely validate the token's validity and integrity.


Major benefits:

1. No Session to Manage (stateless): The JWT is a self-contained token including authentication information, expiration time information, and other digitally signed user-defined claims.

2. Portable - A single token can be used with numerous backends, making it portable.

3. Mobile-friendly - Because there are no cookies required, it is extremely mobile-friendly.
